Project Name - AirBnb Bookings Analysis

Project Summary:

Airbnb (ABNB) is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in specific locales.

In 2008, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia founded Airbnb, Users can access the platform conveniently through its website or mobile application.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world.

Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customer's and provider's (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

That's precisely why we rely on EDA. EDA assists us in examining data without hastily drawing conclusions. It helps us check for mistakes, understand how data behaves, and find surprises like outliers or strange events. EDA isn't just about fixing errors; it's about getting a good grip on how data works and discovering interesting connections between different things in the data.
